# Basic-funcs
Some basic functions in python to basic goals. Mostly **one-liner**.

## But, what is a one-liner?
Well, a one-liner is a one line way to solve a problem. Usually is a small task like iterating over a list with conditional, creating a dictionary easily, cleaning and/or formating data, etc.

## Why make it one-liner and almost unreadable?
Python is a powerful language and has its own way of writing things, like most other languages. The thing I think it stands out is that it approximates to the common language we speak. That's why I'll also explain every one-liner, how to get there and how to read it.
